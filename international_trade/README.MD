**NB-** Although most figures used in the slides are created by the code and data provided, some have been produced by others. 
Specifically a number of diagrams on the theoretical side of things were taken from: 
* [International Economics](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Krugman-International-Economics-9th-Edition/9780132146654.html), by Krugman et al. 
* The excellent lecture material from [Deardorff](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/courses/441/441.html)
* In the UCD lecture on the specific factors model, the diagrams illustrating the effect of migration were produced by Marc Melitz
